There are extra txt files called "worst(number)" and "best(number)" so that I could answer Q1.

1. I have completed the insertion sort and merge sort. With the help from my colleagues, I was able to have the
insertion sort working and got pointers for merge sort. I couldn't hand in the lab earlier due to complications that 
can be attributed to the SSH client not giving permission to execute programs.

2. Insertion Sort:
worst:
	comparisons: n^2

	swaps: n^2

	copy: n

best:
	comparisons: n, specifically 3n

	swap: 0

	copy: n, specifically 3n

average: 
	comparisons: constant*n

	swap: constant*n

	copy: constant*n

b. Merge Sort:
worst:
	compare: looks like n, but most probably n^2 due to it being worst case

	swap: 0

	copy: n, same as compare.
best:	
	compare: n

	swap: 0

	copy: n

average: 
	compare: constant*n

	swap: 0

	copy: constant*n
