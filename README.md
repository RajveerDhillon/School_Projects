## Coe 428 Engineering Algorithms and Data Structures
### Lab work in C on Quincy
Using Algorithms such as Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Selection Sort, Heaps, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree... etc.


## Coe 528 Object Oriented Eng Analysis and Design
### Lab work in Java and NetBeans
A more thorough course on Design Patterns with the Final Project being a Bank Application incorporating Design Patterns and a basic GUI.


## Coe 538 Microprocessor Systems
### Lab work in Assembly on CodeWarrior
Introduction to MIPS and HCS12 Assembly coding with 8, 16 and 32 bit systems, particularly on a board and a battery powered "eebot" with peripherals.


## Coe 608 Operating Systems
### Lab work in C on Linux
Operating systems basic concepts such as process management, scheduling, inter-process communication and synchronization, process starvation and deadlocks.


## Coe 718 Embedded Systems Design

## Coe 758 Digital Systems Engineering
### Lab work in VHDL on Xilinx ISE
System Architecture around the processor with 2 major projects: A Cache Controller and a simulation of Pong using VGA Signal Generator on the Spartan FPGA Board.


## Coe 768 Computer Networks
### Lab work in C on Linux
Introduction course in Computer Networks in which OSI and TCP/IP network architecture models were examined. Lab work focused on stop-and-wait protocol based BSD socket.


## Coe 817 Network Security
### Lab work in Java on NetBeans
Cyber Security course focusing on implementation of IP security, Key Management, Authentication Protocols, Wireless Network Security, E-mail Security and Firewalls.


## Coe 838 System-on-Chip Design
### Lab work in SystemC and VHDL on Linux and Quartus
Design elements of System-on-Chip with topics on Hardware-Software co-specification, co-synthesis and Network-on-Chip systems. Labs mainly focused on Simulations of Arithmetic-based ALUs, Accelerators, JPEG Encoder/Decoder unit coded on SystemC and SoC Design projects on DE1 board coded in VHDL on Quartus.


## Coe 848 Fundamentals of Data Engineering 
### Lab work in SQL on SQLite
Data mangement using SQL and Non-SQL methods with topics: entity-relation diagrams, relation databases, data definition and manipulation languages, structured data representations formats, development of novel vocabularies and semi-structured data. Lab work was a course project of a Database of Games created by a Company with work done in SQlite Studio, lab 5 done on NetBeans and various XML files.

## Notes
Majority of my projects are for Computer Engineering Courses.
